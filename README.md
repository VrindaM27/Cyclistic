# Case Study - Cyclistic Bike Share

I finished my case study on "Cyclistic," a fictional bikeshare firm situated in Chicago, Illinois. The company owns and operates a fleet of over 5000 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of over 600 stations across Chicago.The company serves two types of customers-casual riders(those who purchase single-ride or full-day passes) and annual members(those who purchase annual memberships).Since annual membership is more profitable for the company, the marketing director was interested in maximizing the number of annual members by creating marketing strategies that aid in the conversion of more casual riders to annual members.My responsibility was to make data-driven recommendations for the marketing campaign.
